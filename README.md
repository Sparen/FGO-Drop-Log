# Sparen's FGO Drop Rate Log

Welcome to my Fate/Grand Order North America server drop rate contribution log.

This project, started October 15, 2017, aims to log my contributions to the crowdsourcing for free and daily quest drop rates in Fate/Grand Order. I am storing publicly as a git repository so that I can visually see when I mess up (since I guarantee I will forget to do something eventually), and so that others can see where the numbers I contribute are coming from.

This repository supports GitHub Pages:  
[https://sparen.github.io/FGO-Drop-Log/free-quest.html]  
[https://sparen.github.io/FGO-Drop-Log/daily-quest.html]  
[https://sparen.github.io/FGO-Drop-Log/event-quest.html]  

In order to accomplish the task in a way that is intuitive to me, I have decided to use downsampled versions of the game's proper graphics for item drops. 

This repository is not open to pull requests. As it is a personal log, it is meant to track exclusively my contributions. I used to discourage forking here in the README but since I created the repo the organization and structure of the system has improved by a few orders of magnitude. It's still a mess, but hey; it works!

P.S. Don't look at the JavaScript. The nested loops are hideous.

As of yet, I do not know how long I will maintain this project, or how many different things I will cover. However, the data is available for those who are curious.
