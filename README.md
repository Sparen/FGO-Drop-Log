# Sparen's FGO Drop Rate Log

Welcome to my Fate/Grand Order North America server drop rate contribution log.

This project, started October 15, 2017, aims to log my contributions to the crowdsourcing for free and daily quest drop rates in Fate/Grand Order. I am storing publicly as a git repository so that I can visually see when I mess up (since I guarantee I will forget to do something eventually), and so that others can see where the numbers I contribute are coming from.

This repository supports GitHub Pages:  
[https://sparen.github.io/FGO-Drop-Log/free-quest.html]  
[https://sparen.github.io/FGO-Drop-Log/daily-quest.html]  

In order to accomplish the task in a way that is intuitive to me, I have decided to use downsampled versions of the game's proper graphics for item drops. 

This repository is not open to pull requests. As it is a personal log, it is meant to track exclusively my contributions. I also discourage forking the project and trying to use the system for yourself, as the HTML tables and font sizes + image sizes were haphazardly cobbled together so that they can barely fit on my screen, let alone yours. Additionally, I wedged myself into an admittedly horrible way of keeping track of drops due to the monthly consolidation of drop data and the necessity to avoid providing duplicate data.

As of yet, I do not know how long I will maintain this project, or how many different things I will cover (e.g. events). However, the data is available for those who are curious.
