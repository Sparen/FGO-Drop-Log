# Sparen's FGO Drop Rate Log

Welcome to my Fate/Grand Order North America server drop rate contribution log.

This project, started October 15, 2017, aims to log my contributions to the crowdsourcing for free and daily quest drop rates in Fate/Grand Order. I am storing publicly as a git repository so that I can visually see when I mess up (hooray for source control!), and so that others can see where the numbers I contribute are coming from.

Also included in this repository is a basic Servant list (not always up to date) and some custom utilities used for taking data from the game and converting it to a format that can be used in logging.

This repository supports GitHub Pages:

This repository is not open to pull requests. As it is a personal log, it is meant to track exclusively my contributions. I used to discourage forking here in the README but in the time since I created the repo, the organization and structure of the system has improved by a few orders of magnitude. It's still a mess, but hey; it works!

As of yet, I do not know how long I will maintain this project, or how many different things I will cover. However, the data and utility source code is available for those who are curious.

For more information, refer to the live site.
